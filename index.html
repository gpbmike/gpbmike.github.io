  <p>
    Hi, welcome to my corner of the web. I am a developer of many years who enjoys improving the lives of others through the
    web. I have worked for both small and large companies. I have built sites for dozens of users and I have built sites for
    millions of users. I craft tools to help you get things done and hopefully have a little fun in the process.
  </p>

  <p>
    I currently work for Esri on
    <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-reality/products/site-scan-for-arcgis">Site Scan for ArcGIS</a>.

      <dd>I look up coordinate systems
        <em>a lot</em>
        at work. I wanted something simpler to use than what was out there. So I made it.</dd>

      <dd>My coworkers regularly play a geography wordle clone. The ads are obnoxiously in your face on the site they use so I
        made a simple clone of it. Without ads.</dd>
