    Hi, welcome to my corner of the web. I am a developer of many years who
    enjoys improving the lives of others through the web. I have worked for both
    small and large companies. I have built sites for dozens of users and I have
    built sites for millions of users. I craft tools to help you get things done
    and hopefully have a little fun in the process.
  </p>

  <p>
    I currently work for Esri on
    <a

      >Site Scan for ArcGIS</a
    >.
